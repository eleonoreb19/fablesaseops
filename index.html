  <h1>THE APE AND HER YOUNG ONES.</h1>


     <p>An Ape having two young ones, was dotingly fond of one, but disregarded
and slighted the other. One day she chanced to be surprized by the
hunters, and had much ado to get off.</p>

 <p>However, she did not forget her favourite young one, which she took up in her arms, that it might be
the more secure: the other, which she neglected, by natural instinct,
leapt upon her back, and so away they scampered together;</p>

 <p class="conclusion">But itunluckily fell out, in the over-anxiety of her precipitate flight,
confused and blinded with haste, that she struck her favourite’s head
against a branch.Which threw it on the ground, where the darling
bantling was seized by the dogs and killed. The hated one, clinging
close to her rough back, escaped all the danger of the pursuit.</p>

  <h1>THE BOY AND HIS MOTHER.</h1>


      <p>A little Boy having stolen a book from one of his school-fellows,
took it to his Mother, who, instead of correcting him, praised his
sharpness, and rewarded him. </p>

<p>In process of time, as he grew bigger,
he increased also in villainy, till at length he was taken up for
committing a great robbery, and was brought to justice and condemned
for it. As the officers were conducting him to the gallows, he was
attended by a vast crowd, and among the rest his Mother came sobbing
along, and deploring her son’s unhappy fate;</p>
<p class="final"> which the criminal observing, he begged leave to speak to her: this being granted, he put
his mouth to her ear, as if he was going to whisper something, and
bit it off! The officer, shocked at this behaviour, asked him if the
crimes he had committed were not sufficient to glut his wickedness,
without being also guilty of such an unnatural violence towards his
mother? Let no one wonder, said he, that I have done this to her, for
she deserves even worse at my hands. For if she had chastised instead
of praising and encouraging me, when I stole my school-fellow’s book, I
should not now have been brought to this ignominious and untimely end.</p>

<h1>INDUSTRY AND SLOTH.</h1>


    <p>An indolent Young Man being asked why he lay in bed so long? jocosely
answered, “Every morning of my life I am hearing causes. </p>

<p>I have twofine girls, their names are Industry and Sloth, close at my bed-side
as soon as I awake, pressing their different suits. One intreats me to
get up, the other persuades me to lie still;</p>

<p class="conclusion">And then they alternately
give me various reasons why I should rise, and why I should not. This
detains me so long, (it being the duty of an impartial judge to hear
all that can be said on either side) that before the pleadings are
over, it is time to go to dinner.”</p>
